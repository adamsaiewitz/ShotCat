# ShotCat
A lightweight database tool for film and television post-production.

# History
Many film and television productions hack together a database for footage tracking. Methods are varied and rely on
software that could be deprecated virtually overnight. Scripted features and television shows use custom Filemaker
templates; in my time in unscripted reality television post-production, I've seen bad implementations of notes, logs,
transcripts, and so on, with no way to search across them without third-party tools. I'd like to fix that.

# Roadmap
I plan to make this an open source, lightweight alternative to these sort of messy solutions. I'm not a professional
coder by trade, so this will be a learning process. There are no promises and no guarantees of delivery; features will
be added at my leisure. Nyeh nyeh.
